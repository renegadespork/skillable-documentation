## What is integration?
Integration is how your platform interacts with Skillable. 

Skillable provides users with a custom LMS called Skillable TMS (https://lms.learnondemand.net), which has full integration with Skillable Labs out-of-the-box. 

However, some clients prefer to use their own learning platforms that connect with Skillable Labs behind the scenes so their users can have a seamless expierence without leaving your platform. Integration is the back-end connection that makes this possible.

## What integration options does Skillable provide?
There are many ways to integrate your platform with Skillable, but they boil down to 4 main categories:
 - **Lab API** - Launch and interact with labs. \[[Learn More](https://connect.skillable.com/lab/overview/)\]
 - **TMS API** - Remotely manage your TMS resources. \[[Learn More](https://connect.skillable.com/tms/overview/)\]
 - **Learning Tools Interoperability (LTI)** - API standard created by ISM Global that is used on many popular Learning Management Systems. \[[Learn More](./integration-setup-lti.md)\]
 - **Custom Authentication** - Allow users to sign into Skillable using your own platform's authentication. \[[Learn More](https://docs.skillable.com/lod/saml-integration.md)\]
